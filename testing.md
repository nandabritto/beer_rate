# Testing

During code development of each function tests were in place to be sure that it was running as expected. The following sections describe all tests are done and error handling in place.

## Code Validation Testing

#### Python (PEP8) Validation


#### CSS Code Validation

#### JavaScript Code Validation


## Exploratory Testing



#### Initial User Testing (Alpha)

A session was held with an end user. The feedback obtained is listed below:

+ Navbar

1 - The page which we are is slightly highlighted, I would like a more visual appealing color to better differentiate which page I am.

2 - "Beer Styles" dropdown menu is mixed with operational menu options. I would like to have on Left: "Best Beer" (as home), "Beer Reviews", "Beer Styles" and "Search your beer". On Right, "Register", "Login", "Logout".

+ Home Page

I would like to have option to login directly form there, without needing to go to login page, and then log in.

+ Register User Page

1 - When entered a password that do not match, a very quick message appeared on top, but it was not possible to read in time. I would like this message sticks on bottom of "Register" container so users can read and understand error.

2 - When logged successful, I have been redirected to home page, page which I just came from. I would like to be redirected to reviews page, where I can actually use information on website.

+ Beer Reviews page

1 - I would like to have option to search, filter and choose different sort option (like Money-Value) directly on page, without needing to go through top bar

2 - The "Beer reviews" title looks blended with background image, I would like to use larger box with different text size or even some logo image. This "Beer reviews" there may also not be required if top bar use more distinct color when page is the one selected.

3 - Buttons "First Next Last" looks too close to card box and background color blend then. I would like a better visual to differentiate they are buttons and not random text on foot of page.

4 - The page should inform default sort order, like displaying "Latest beer reviews" instead of just "Beer reviews" and sort that page by review date.


+ Review Detail Page 

1 - On bottom of review container, where we see "Written by:", I would rather to have it as "Review by: <name of author>"  and on same row "Created at: <date>"
